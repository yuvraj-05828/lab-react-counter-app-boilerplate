# Kalvium Lab | Counter App

## Learning Goals

The learning goal for this exercise will be to understand the usage of `states` using `class components`.

Whenever you create a first significant change, you should make your first commit.

3. Follow these [guidelines to add, commit and push changes](https://github.com/Kalvium-Program/general-guidelines-labs-project-builders).

### Introduction

Your task is to create a simple `counter app`, as shown below:

![counter-app](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/kalvi-education.github.io/front-end-web-development/counter-app.gif)


**NOTE:** The design need not be exactly the same, but the structure must be same. The structure should be as follows:

1. Name of the app --> `Counter App`
2. Below the name of the app, the `counter` should be displayed.
3. Below the counter, there should be three buttons on the same line. The three buttons should be - 
    1. Increase button --> which will increament the counter by one.
    2. Decrease button --> which will decreament the counter by one.
    3. Reset button --> which will reset the counter to 0.

use `npm create vite@latest name-of-the-app` command to create the react app. Then choose **react** and **javascript**.

Make sure you are using `class component` to complete this exercise.

Happy Coding Kalvium ❤️!
